CS 5004: Object Oriented Design Course Files, Align MS in Computer Science, Northeastern University, Fall 2022

## Description 
This project contains homework, lab, and exam files for CS 5004 - Object Oriented Design. This course is part of core requirements for the Align MS in Computer Science program at Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University (www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/align-masters-of-science-in-computer-science/). 

Course description:  This course provides an intensive tour of class-based program design and the design of abstractions that support the design of reusable software and libraries. It reviews typical object-oriented concepts such as information hiding, encapsulation and various forms of polymorphism. It contrasts the use of inheritance and composition as dual techniques for software reuse. It provides a deeper understanding of object-oriented design using the use of graphical design notations such as UML and object-oriented design patterns. It also examines the relationship between algorithms and data structures, as well as basic techniques for analyzing algorithm complexity. Finally it emphasizes on testing, specifically unit testing of components.

Programming language: Java
